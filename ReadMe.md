Description of the dataset

## Objectives

Win, of course!

## Ideas

Below is a list of the first ideas:

1. Classify the entries based on the type of store (restaurant, pharmacy ...), use this as color coding or drop-down menu in a shiny app
2. Compute the distance between the conference center and the entries 
3. Compute commuting time from the conference center to the entries (walking, bus ...)
4. Look for clusters, ie some areas in town where many stores are ...
