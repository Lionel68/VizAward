# Visualization Award GfO 2016

This repository is for sharing and updating the code for the visualization awards at the GfO conference in Marburg in 2016.

## The data

Description of the dataset

## Objectives

Win, of course!

## Ideas

Below is a list of the first ideas:

1. Classify the entries based on the type of store (restaurant, pharmacy ...), use this as color coding or drop-down menu in a shiny app
2. Compute the distance between the conference center and the entries 
3. Compute commuting time from the conference center to the entries (walking, bus ...)
4. Look for clusters, ie some areas in town where many stores are ...

##Next steps

* Discuss ideas and set workflow (18.07.2016)

##TO DO:

### Shiny

-> When hovering on a bus stop: Show nearby stores + in a window: bus stop name and bus lines numbers

-> When clicking on a bus stop: Show nearby stores + plot bus lines

-> Add the option to show all information on the map

-> Make the map bigger
